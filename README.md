dotfiles
========
This is my personal collection of dotfiles for various shells and tools.

Usage
=====
Clone the repository:

    git clone git://github.com/martinp/dotfiles.git

Create symlinks:

    make install

...or create and configure a VM using the included `Vagrantfile`:

    vagrant up

NOTE: This will overwrite your existing dotfiles.
